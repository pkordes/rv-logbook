# PR CI — runs when a pull request targets main.
# Goal: confirm the merge commit is clean and gate on any PR-only checks.
# Re-runs the same fast checks as the branch workflow on the actual merge commit.
# Playwright E2E tests will be added here in Phase 9 (they need a running stack).

  # e2e:
  #   name: Frontend / E2E (Playwright)
  #   # Added in Phase 9 — requires the full stack (API + DB) to be running.
  #   # Lives in the PR tier because E2E catches integration regressions that
  #   # unit tests cannot, but the cost (minutes) is only acceptable at PR time.
